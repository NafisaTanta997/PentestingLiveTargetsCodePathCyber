# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

Description:
This vulnerability is for the blue website because it said "blue" in the website's address.

When I tried logging in with the existing username provided in the assignement overview, the login page gave a different error
compared to when I tried logging in with a username that does not exist. 
In this case, I already knew a possible username for this website. However, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability and figure
out possible usernames and then try and hack those.

I provided the walkthrough of how I reached my reasoning. In case the video does not play here, kindly check the appropriate gif
file for this vulnerability.

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection

Description:
This website (blue version) responded to the SQL Injection which caused it to show the information of a different sales person under 
the same id (id = 7) when the phrase "' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'" was added at the end of the url. 

The developer did not properly sanitize the URL.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference

Description:
This vulnerability is for the red website because I was able to exploit this vulnerability when I switched from blue to read.

Once I switched to red, I was able to access hidden information of the salespeople in this company. Just like I was able to find
Lazy Lazyman, who was fired for stealing, from the company accounts, an attacker can use this weakness and find information on
many other sales people in this company too.
